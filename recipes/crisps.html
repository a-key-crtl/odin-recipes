    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sizzle Crisps are an all time favorite Fire Nation snack! It is a staple of every street vendor and comes in many options. Dragon's Breath is very popular!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 tablespoons chile oil </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons Sansho pepper powder </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons togarashi </li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon sugar (optional) </li>
        <li> One 12-ounce package sliced bacon, preferably applewood smoked, cut into thirds </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl, and thoroughly coat each slice of bacon. Let marinate at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li> Preheat oven to 325 deg Fahrenheit. Place bacon strips on a sheet tray outfitted with a wire rack.</li>
        <li> Roast until bacon has shrunk considerably in size, is curling at edges, and lightly blackened at sides. 10 to 15 minutes. You;ll want it to be almost burned, this is a Fire Nation snack after all!</li>
        <li> Remove bacon from oven, and drain on paper towels before serving. </li>
        <li> Don't waste the bacon fat! Strain it and use it for other tasty foods like a bacony chile sauce for noodles. </li>
    </ol>
